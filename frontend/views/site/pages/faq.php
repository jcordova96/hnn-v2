    <a name="privacy"></a><span><b> WHAT'S HNN'S PRIVACY POLICY ?</b></span>
</p>

<p> HNN takes the privacy of our readers seriously . The only information we collect from our users is the email
    address they use to subscribe to our newsletters . We do not collect information about the choices individual
    users make on the site . We do not leave cookies on their computers to track their online behavior .</p>

<p><span><b><a name="tilt"></a> WHICH WAY DOES HNN TILT, LEFT OR RIGHT ?</b></span></p>

<p> George Mason University's History News Network (HNN) features articles and excerpts by historians from both the
    left and the right. Some weeks we may appear to tilt one way or the other simply because of serendipity. But our
    aim is to present a wide mix of views. <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/820.html#mission">Click here to read our
        mission statement.</a></p>

<p><span><b><a name="hnn1"></a>HOW IS HNN ORGANIZED?</b></span></p>

<p>HNN is organized into a variety of departments, which can easily be accessed on every page from the menu located
    on the left-hand columns.</p>

<p>Half a dozen interns and readers of HNN are responsible for the fascinating list of stories featured every day on
    the <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/roundup/41.html">Breaking News</a> page, which allows readers to keep track of both
    important and interesting developments related to history.</p>

<p>Our homepage features the original articles published weekly by HNN contributors. They are divided into <a
        href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/13807.html">categories</a> so readers can easily follow particular subjects of
    concern. Major categories include: News at Home, News Abroad, Historians &amp; History, Education, and Culture
    Watch.</p>

<p>Our most popular department -- and our biggest -- is <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/6975.html">Roundup</a>,
    which is divided into a number of subdepartments and includes excerpts from articles from around the Web. In our
    Friday <a href="//lists.drizzle.com/mailman/listinfo/hnn-news">newsletter</a> we list the Top 10 excerpts,
    but these comprise just a brief sampling of the extensive collection of excerpts we post every week.</p>

<p>The <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/6976.html">Features department</a> lists services we provide: lists of
    interviews with historians, great history quotes, highlights from the AHA &amp; OAH conventions, and the like.
    The <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/roundup/36.html">Books department</a> displays reviews by HNN's book editors as well
    as excerpts from reviews of books that relate history and current events . (Every month HNN features a Book of
    the Month .)</p>

<p> HNN features two departments that address the specific needs of <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/855.html">
        students</a>&nbsp;and teachers(<a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/teachers_edition/grades_3_to_6.html"> grade school </a>
    and&nbsp;<a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/teachers_edition/grades_9_to_12.html"> high school </a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p> Please keep in mind that we feature a broad range of ideological views .</p>

<p>If you ever have any questions about HNN, please feel free to <a href="mailto:editor@historynewsnetwork.org">
        contact editors Rick Shenkman and David Walsh </a>. We welcome suggestions!</p>

<p><span><b><a name="civil"></a> WHAT RULES GOVERN COMMENTS ?</b></span></p>

<p> When a new employee asked Thomas Edison what the rules at his lab were, Edison reportedly cracked, <i> We don't
        have rules. We're trying to accomplish something </i>. Great line, but in practice rules sometimes are
    needed . These are the rules HNN has implemented to govern the posting of comments on our threaded discussion
    boards .</p>

<p> Please do not post any comments that are defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, bigoted, or unlawful . If
    you violate the law or are guilty of defamation you may be held legally responsible .</p>

<p> Please do not post any comments that are anti - Semitic or racist . Please do not malign ethnic or religious
    groups .</p>

<p> Please do not post any advertisements for commercial products or services .</p>

<p> Please do not use our boards to promote surveys, contests, or chain letters .</p>

<p> Please be civil . No ad hominem attacks .</p>

<p> Please do not post comments that are irrelevant to the subject under discussion .</p>

<p> We reserve the right to bounce any person who violates our rules and to delete their comments .</p>

<p> Flagrant violators of <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/1885.html"> HNN's standards</a> will be banned.
    Offensive comments will be deleted.</p>

<p>NOTE: Posts to HNN's blogs may be deleted if the bloggers find the posts irritating, offensive, or distracting,
    whether the posts violate HNN's rules of civility or not.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: We do not attest to the accuracy or truthfulness of any of the views or facts posted on our
    discussion boards. Nor do we monitor every posted comment.</p>

<p><span><b><a name="advertising"></a>DO YOU ACCEPT ADVERTISING?</b></span></p>

<p>Yes, we welcome advertisers! We also accept help from underwriters (just as PBS does). If you would like either
    to advertise or make an underwriter's donation to HNN, please let us know by dropping an email to the < a
    href="mailto:editor@hnn.us" > editor .</a></p>

<p> HNN will gladly post a notice on our site or in our newsletter indicating your participation in our underwriting
    program .</p>

<p><span><b><a name="bn"></a> WHAT KIND OF NEWS STORIES DO YOU COVER ?</b></span></p>

<p> The <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/roundup/41.html"> Breaking News page </a> features news stories reported in the
    English - language press . The result is that the page is heavily skewed toward subjects that draw the attention
    of English - speaking readers, leading to a heavy concentration of stories from the United States and Western
    Europe . <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/6364.html"> Click here </a> to view the lists of media sources HNN
    interns use to track news stories we cover .</p>

<p><span><b><a name="intern"></a> HOW DO I APPLY FOR AN INTERNSHIP AT HNN ?</b></span></p>

<p> Here are the basic facts: Internships are for a minimum term of two quarters . You should expect to put in
    around 10 hours a week . <strong> INTERNS DO NOT HAVE TO WORK AT HNN'S OFFICES</strong>, though interns located
    in the Washington D.C. area are encouraged to work directly with the editor at our Washington office. Interns
    will communicate with the editor(s) through e-mail, Skype, and the telephone. Basically, if you have access to
    the Internet, you can be an intern at HNN!</p>

<p>All internships are unpaid, but class credit can be arranged.</p>

<p><a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/9749.html">Click here</a> to read about intern responsibilities.</p>

<p>As you'll see, this is not a make - work job . You'll do real work; nothing Mickey Mouse.</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying for an internship please send your resume to the editor, David Walsh. BE SURE
    TO INCLUDE THE INTERNSHIP YOU wish to apply for.</p>

<p><span><b><a name="scholarly"></a>IS HNN CONSIDERED A SCHOLARLY JOURNAL?</b></span></p>

<p>HNN was created to give historians the opportunity to reach a national audience on issues of public concern. It
    is not a scholarly journal. It is a vehicle for scholars seeking to enrich the public debate.</p>

<p><span><b><a name="SHOULD"></a>WHY SHOULD THE PUBLIC WANT TO HEAR FROM
            HISTORIANS?</b></span></p>

<p>Historians are not entitled to be heard from simply because they are scholars. They must have something to say.
    But neither can the fact that they are scholars deprive them of the right to weigh in on matters of vital public
    importance. Indeed, the fact that they bring to the public debate a special expertise and sensibility derived
    from their studies is all the more reason to give them a hearing. Leaving the public square to people who lack
    the scholar's knowledge diminishes democracy .</p>

<p> Responding to news events in a timely and wise manner is a great challenge, of course . Fortunately, none of our
    contributors fail at the task all of the time and most succeed at it at least some of the time . That they may
    fail on occasion is no reason to conclude they should therefore never be given the chance to succeed ever again
    .</p>

<p><span><b><a name="reprint"></a> CAN I REPRINT ARTICLES POSTED ON HNN ?</b></span></p>

<p> HNN publishes original pieces on our homepage . Because HNN encourages the wide dissemination of information,
    all of our content is licensed under <a href="//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"> Creative Commons
        3.0 </a>. Readers are free to copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt HNN content provided that HNN is clearly
    identified as the source .</p>

<p> HNN also excerpts articles in the Roundup Department that were published elsewhere . We do not own the copyright
    of these articles . Please contact the listed SOURCE of the article to find out if it can be reprinted .</p>

<p><span><b><a name="roundup"></a> WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE ROUNDUP DEPARTMENT
            ?</b></span></p>

<p> HNN originally was conceived as primarily a national platform for historians wishing to comment on current
    events . This remains our primary function as is evident on our homepage, where week after week historians write
    about news subjects within their area of expertise .</p>

<p> But as the website evolved we added various features that we thought our readers would find interesting and
    useful . The most popular feature has turned out to be <a href="//historynewsnetwork.org/articles/1203.html"> ROUNDUP</a>
    , which includes excerpts and articles from the media about various issues related in some way to history .</p>

<p> We don't vouch for the accuracy or scholarship of the excerpts or articles. We simply reprint them. The purpose
    is to give readers in one handy place a broad sampling of American (and indeed world) opinion. In effect, we
    turn every reader into his own Walt Whitman, strolling through the alleys of the Internet to see what strange
    and wonderful and often ugly things the world has to offer. Everyman his own journalist, to paraphrase Carl
    Becker.</p>

<p>But even the ugly?</p>

<p>Walter Lippman in the 1920s pointed out that journalism is about creating pictures in our minds of what the real
    world is like, a most difficult task. How much more difficult, indeed impossible, it is to attain that goal if
    we blind ourselves to sights that make us shudder or shrink in horror.</p>

<p>At the same time we do not publish the views of Holocaust Deniers in Roundup--or authors who take similarly
    extreme positions. Including them in Roundup would indirectly give them a credence they do not deserve. We do of
    course from time to time run articles, excerpts and news stories <i>about</i> people who hold obnoxious views
    like Holocaust Deniers.</p>

<p><span><b><a name="submissions"></a>HOW DO I SUBMIT AN ARTICLE TO HNN FOR PUBLICATION?</b></span>
</p>

<p>HNN reaches a large number of readers. The website attracts some 300,000 unique visitors a month and 6 million
    hits. Writing for HNN can help you find an audience for your ideas and publications.</p>

<p>HNN encourages readers to send in articles for possible publication concerning subjects in their area of
    expertise. Because we need to be able to assure our readers that writers are experts in the areas they discuss,
    we request that all submissions be accompanied by a resume.</p>

<p>Articles should either tell the reader something new or frame an old issue in a new way. Articles may include the
    author's opinion but primarily serve as vehicles for informed analysis with an emphasis on history .</p>

<p> HNN encourages the wide dissemination of information and therefore allows other publications to reprint our
    articles unless the author expressly requests copyright protection .</p>

<p> Writers should know that HNN allows search engines such as Google and Yahoo to use spiders to search the
    archives and post search results .</p>

<p> The editor reserves the right to select the title of any piece published by HNN .</p>

<p> Once a piece has been published the author relinquishes the right to withdraw it .</p>

<p> Please be sure to tell us how you would like to be identified .</p>

<p>If your article draws on research you have published in a book we'll happily feature the book's jacket and a link
    to the website of your choice .</p>

<p>If possible, articles should be forwarded by email as a Microsoft WORD attachment . If this is impossible, please
    simply paste the article into an email . Submissions should be sent to David Austin Walsh at the following
    address: <a href="mailto:editor@historynewsnetwork.org"> editor@historynewsnetwork . org </a>.</p>

<p> Article length may vary depending on subject matter . Most articles run about 1,000 words .</p>

<p> Authors should disclose in advance to the editor any potential conflict of interest they have which may affect
    their objectivity--or may <i>appear </i> to do so .</p>

<p><span><b><a name="rss"></a> DOES HNN FEATURE RSS FEEDS ? (WHAT IS RSS ?)</b></span></p>

<p> In an attempt to make our content more easily accessible, HNN is now providing RSS feeds for most departments .
    Huh ?</p>

<p> RSS feeds allow users with an RSS reader to keep track of websites every time specific pages are updated . Say,
    for instance, you like HNN blog Cliopatria and you want to know when it's updated. By using an RSS reader you
    will be notified the moment a new entry is posted on the blog. The system even allows you to find out every time
    one of the Roundup pages has been updated with new material or when our homepage is updated. With an RSS reader
    you can see which of your favorite sites have been updated at-a-glance without having to go through the trouble
    of surfing each site one by one.</p>

<p>Sounds complicated. It's not . Just download one of the RSS readers listed below . Then add a channel for each
    web page you want to follow closely . The RSS feeds are located in the left - hand column, at the bottom of
    everything else in the column . (Look for the bright blue button that says RSS .) The RSS Feeds for the <a
        href="//historynewsnetwork.org/roundup/41.html"> Breaking News </a> page are located at the top .</p>

<p> Click on the button . This will bring up a page with a lot of html gibberish . Ignore it . All you need to pay
    attention to is the URL . The RSS reader will ask you for this URL when you go to add a channel .</p>
